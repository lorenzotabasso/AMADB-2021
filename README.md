We used Docker in order to setup the same envoriment om nultiple machines. To run the project, you'll first have to install Docker.

You can install Docker in several ways. If you're using Linux the best way is to install it using your favorite package manager, othwerise, visit [Docker download page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
```

```bash

brew install --cask docker
```


```powershell
# Windows (Chocolately)
choco install docker-desktop
```

After installation, verify that Docker is correclty running with

```bash
docker info
```

If you are on unix sistem you maybe need to follow this post-installation step
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

### Python

This entire project is developed in Python 3.7 using virtual enviroments. If you don't have Python installed on ypur machine, you first need to install python and then install all the dependencies needed for run the project.

You can install python via web visiting [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or with your favorite package manager.

```

```bash
# MacOS
brew install python@3.7 # At least 3.7
```


```powershell
# Windows (Chocolately)
choco install python3

Then, to create the virtual enviroment see this [guide](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) from official python docs.
